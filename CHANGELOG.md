# Changelog - Notable Changes in Dev Version

## Refactoring and Code Quality Improvements

- **F-String Cleanup:**  
  Replaced all fâ€‘strings without any placeholders (F541) with regular string concatenation or proper formatting. This eliminates the flake8 F541 errors.

- **Line Formatting:**  
  Split multiple statements on one line (E701 errors) into individual lines for clarity and compliance with PEP 8.

- **Unused Imports Removed:**  
  Removed or commented out unused imports (e.g., `getpass`, `dotenv.load_dotenv`, and unused members from `os.path`) to resolve F401 errors.

- **Improved Error Messaging:**  
  Enhanced error messages in database connection logic and file I/O operations (such as during credential file writing and .env updates) to be more informative and provide actionable troubleshooting tips.

- **Logging Standardization:**  
  Streamlined logging messages across bootstrap and user-creation scripts to ensure consistency and easier debugging during the bootstrap process.

- **Code Comment Cleanup:**  
  Removed excessive inline comments and redundant annotations to improve overall readability and maintainability of the scripts.

- **Semantic-Release Alignment:**  
  Adjusted version-update commands and file paths (ensuring they correctly reference existing files) to resolve issues with our semantic-release pipeline.

These changes not only resolve the current linting and formatting issues but also enhance the robustness and clarity of our bootstrap and orchestration scripts, ultimately leading to a smoother developer experience.
